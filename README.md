## Description
Hello, my name is Manuel DÃ­az from WinT 3794 team, and I come to announce the next launch of our driver station, LiteDS.
LiteDS is an open-source application that is made to simplify communications with your robot.
This is a cross-platform application because its engine was programmed directly in JAVA. 

### Platforms
The application will be starting for Android devices only, but in the future, it will be for iOS, Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### Protocols
Also, it will have great protocol support, because it will have the protocol collection from Aerial Assist (2014) to Infinite Recharge (2020).

### New LibDS
If you would like to give more protocol support or you only want to improve the engine, you can clone the source code of the application engine, New-LibDS.
New-LibDS is a cross-platform engine that handles all your UDP and TCP protocol connections, GamePad management, Alliance and Position control, execution modes (TeleOperated, Autonomous, Test and, Practice), and more.

### Inspired
This application was inspired by QDriverStation by Alex Spataru, but this app is made from scratch because its protocols are older and difficult to understand.
That said, the development of new protocols will be much easier for the next generations to continue working on it.
